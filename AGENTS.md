# Agent Operating Manual

Read this file before making any change in the repository.

This repository is intended to be reused as a template for multiple projects.
The rules below must be followed strictly.

---

## Workflow

1. Read the existing code and documentation before editing anything.
2. Check the current branch with `git branch`.
3. Never work directly on `main`.
4. Create or use a dedicated branch:
   - `feat/...`
   - `fix/...`
   - `docs/...`
   - `chore/...`
   - `test/...`
5. Make small, focused changes.
6. Commit after each logical step.
7. Review the diff before finishing.

---

## Commit rules

- Never batch unrelated changes in one commit.
- Use Conventional Commits:
  - `feat: add portfolio import service`
  - `fix: correct date parsing in dashboard`
  - `docs: rewrite README and setup guide`
  - `chore: update .gitignore`
- Commit frequently. A large task should usually produce several commits.
- Never leave many modified files uncommitted.

---

## Architecture rules

Always preserve a clear separation of concerns.

Preferred architecture:

```text
UI / pages / components
        ↓
services / business logic
        ↓
repositories / api / database layer

Rules:

UI files only handle display and user interaction.
Never put business logic, calculations, SQL, API calls, or data transformations inside UI files.
All business logic belongs in dedicated services/ or domain modules.
Database access belongs in repositories/, db/, api/, or equivalent.
Never mix persistence and business logic in the same file.
Reuse existing services before creating a new one.
Do not duplicate logic.
Create a new file only if no existing file is suitable.
File and code rules
Prefer minimal, targeted changes.
Do not rewrite a whole file if a small edit is enough.
Keep functions focused and easy to read.
Prefer explicit names over short names.
Avoid dead imports and unused variables.
Never use except: pass.
Add or update documentation when behavior changes.
If tests exist, update or add tests for changed behavior.
Never claim something was tested if it was not actually run.
Documentation rules

The repository should always contain:

README.md
AGENTS.md
CLAUDE.md
CONTRIBUTING.md
LICENSE
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md if the project is non-trivial
docs/DEVELOPMENT.md for setup and commands

README requirements:

3 to 6 GitHub badges
Short project description
Features
Tech stack
Installation
Usage
Repository structure
Contributors
Limitations
Never do
Never commit directly to main
Never make broad refactors unless explicitly requested
Never silently change architecture
Never put business logic in UI files
Never create unnecessary files
Never rename or delete files without a good reason
Never mix unrelated fixes in one task
Never invent implementation details without reading the code first
Definition of done

Before finishing a task:

 Correct branch used
 Small logical commits created
 Diff reviewed
 Documentation updated if needed
 No business logic added to UI
 No duplicated logic introduced
 Tests run if relevant
 No unrelated files modified
